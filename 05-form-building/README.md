=======
## Overview
<!-- Provide a general overview of the daily concepts and processes that will be covered in lectures and labs -->

Today we'll code together in an in-class workshop to wire up a new page in our blog app. This is done in lieu of a pair-programming assignment. You will individually fork/clone the lab code, get it working condition, and submit a pull request (by Monday at 8:59am)just as you have been doing with the paired lab assignments.

Note that we probably will not get to 100% functionality in our workshop today *(gotta leave y'all a little bit of work to do, right?)*, and also that there are optional stretch goals.

We'll not work to a schedule, but instead work for an hour or so, take a break, etc., until we finish (or, more accurately, get as close to finished as we're going to get ;-). We should be able to get wrapped up somewhere between 3:00 and 4:00 today.

## Daily Plan

Code review (we'll go until everyone has had a chance to talk about some code, probably 45-60 minutes).

Also, let's discuss and review the first week of 301!

  ```10 minute break```

Start working on the form building workshop, go until 11:30ish, whenever we hit a good stopping point.


  ```30-45 minute break for lunch```

**12:15-1:00p:** [Partner Power Hour](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/partner-power-hour-how-to-ace-your-interviews-and-negotiate-a-higher-starting-salary-tickets-35704727802?aff=CFCalendar) with Josh Doody: *How to Ace Your Interviews and Negotiate a Higher Starting Salary*.

  ```15 minute break```

**1:15p, or so:** Resume working on the form workshop (go for an hour or so, until we hit a good stopping point)

---

From this point on you'll have the the rest of the afternoon to work with a programming partner on a peer review of your portfolio progress, and to work together toward finishing and lingering goals from the Class 4 portfilio assignment.

You will have the weekend to complete and submit the fully working version of the blog form page.


## Learning Objectives
<!--
ABCD:
  Audience: Program participants
  Behavior: Expected learning/behavior changes/results
  Condition:
    Circumstances that lead to change/result
    When change/result are expected to occur
  Degree: How much change occurs (%) for how many participants (#)
-->

* Recap the primary concepts discussed throughout the week.

    * "What have you learned so far?"

    * "What has been challenging to learn?"

    * "What has been helpful?"

* Work through a form-based exercise to build out a JSON string.

* Discuss 3rd party library integration for dynamic code highlighting and markdown creation.
